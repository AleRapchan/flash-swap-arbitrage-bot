# Flash Swap Arbitrage Bot
Smart Contract BOT code, running on Ethereum Blockchain, watching for and executing profitable arbitrage opportunities using flash loans and flash swaps.

Flash loans are an innovative financial product made possible by the atomic nature of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. They allow users to borrow large amounts of cryptocurrency from liquidity pools without collateral if the loan is repaid in the same transaction. They are like leverage trades and margin accounts in traditional finance, but without the need to be approved and provide collateral.  
 
Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) like Uniswap and Sushiswap are cryptocurrency exchanges that use smart contracts to enforce the trading rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary. They allow us to exchange different cryptocurrencies and stable coins quickly. They may be used as part of flash loan strategies to acquire the needed assets.

Arbitrage is arguably the primary use case for flash loans, which means buying cryptocurrency (or an asset) for a price and selling it for a higher price on a different exchange.

The main challenge with arbitrage is that by the time you sell an asset, its price might have changed, but you don’t have that problem with flash loans. Additionally, you don’t have to have the crypto asset; you can borrow it. Therefore, the earning coming from the price difference (spread) will be proportional to the amount traded.
